# ================================================
# Activity 1: Calculate Forecast Accuracy Metrics
# ================================================

# Fit three different models on the same training set
# Generate forecasts for the test set
# Compute MAE, RMSE, and MAPE for each model
# Create a table to compare the results

# Example:
# Split into training and test
# train_data <- time_series_data %>% filter(Time < as.Date("2023-01-01"))
# test_data <- time_series_data %>% filter(Time >= as.Date("2023-01-01"))

# Fit models
# arima_model <- train_data %>% model(ARIMA(TargetVariable))
# ets_model <- train_data %>% model(ETS(TargetVariable))
# naive_model <- train_data %>% model(NAIVE(TargetVariable))

# Generate forecasts
# arima_forecast <- forecast(arima_model, h = nrow(test_data))
# ets_forecast <- forecast(ets_model, h = nrow(test_data))
# naive_forecast <- forecast(naive_model, h = nrow(test_data))

# Evaluate accuracy
# acc_arima <- accuracy(arima_forecast, test_data)
# acc_ets <- accuracy(ets_forecast, test_data)
# acc_naive <- accuracy(naive_forecast, test_data)

# Combine results into a single table
# bind_rows(
#   acc_arima %>% mutate(model = "ARIMA"),
#   acc_ets %>% mutate(model = "ETS"),
#   acc_naive %>% mutate(model = "Naive")
# )

# Try It Out #1: You're evaluating three candidate models: ARIMA, ETS, and a naive baseline

# Steps:
# - Fit all three models to the training set
  # - Separate sets
train <- weekly_demand %>% filter(Date < "2023-01-01")
test <- weekly_demand %>% filter(Date >= "2023-01-01")

  # - Fit models
arima_model <- train %>% model(ARIMA(WeeklyDemand))
ets_model <- train %>% model(ETS(WeeklyDemand))
naive_model <- train %>% model(NAIVE(WeeklyDemand))

# - Forecast on the test set
fc_arima <- forecast(arima_model, h = nrow(test))
fc_ets <- forecast(ets_model, h = nrow(test))
fc_naive <- forecast(naive_model, h = nrow(test))

# - Use accuracy() to compare MAE, RMSE, MAPE
acc_arima <- accuracy(fc_arima, test)
acc_ets <- accuracy(fc_ets, test)
acc_naive <- accuracy(fc_naive, test)

# - Present the results in a table
bind_rows(
  acc_arima %>% mutate(model = "ARIMA"), 
  acc_ets %>% mutate(model = "ETS"), 
  acc_naive %>% mutate(model = "NAIVE")
)
# - ETS performs the best. 


# ================================================
# Activity 2: Apply Time Series Cross-Validation
# ================================================

# Define rolling origin cross-validation
# Train models across each fold
# Collect out-of-sample accuracy
# Compare average metrics across folds

# Example:
# Define training set and cross-validation folds
# train <- weekly_demand %>% filter(Date < as.Date("2023-01-01"))
# cv_folds <- train %>% stretch_tsibble(.init = 52, .step = 4)
# Apply model across folds
# res_cv <- cv_splits %>%
#   model(arima_model = ARIMA(TargetVariable)) %>%
#   forecast(h = 4) %>%
#   accuracy(cv_splits)

# Summarize average MAE and RMSE across folds
# res_cv %>%
#   group_by(.model) %>%
#   summarise(across(.cols = c(MAE, RMSE), mean))

# Try It Out #1: You need to validate model stability over time
# Steps:
# - Create rolling origin splits with stretch_tsibble()
train2 <- weekly_demand %>% filter(Date < as.Date("2023-01-01"))
folds <- train2 %>% 
  stretch_tsibble(.init = 52, .step = 4)

# - Apply ARIMA and ETS models across folds
rolling_models <- folds %>% 
  model(
    arima = ARIMA(WeeklyDemand), 
    ets = ETS(WeeklyDemand)) %>% forecast(h = 4) %>% accuracy(folds) # - Forecast 4 weeks ahead

# - Compare averaged MAE and RMSE
rolling_models %>%
  group_by(.model) %>%
  summarise(across(.cols = c(MAE, RMSE), mean))

# ================================================
# Activity 3: Evaluate Model Complexity and Information Criteria
# ================================================

# Fit competing models to the full dataset
# Use glance() to extract AIC, BIC
# Interpret values (lower = better)

# Example:
# model_comparison <- time_series_data %>% model(
#   arima_model = ARIMA(TargetVariable),
#   ets_model = ETS(TargetVariable)
# )

# glance(model_comparison)

# Try It Out #1: You want to balance accuracy with simplicity

# Steps:
# - Fit ARIMA and ETS models
model_comparison <- weekly_demand %>% model(
  arima_model = ARIMA(WeeklyDemand), 
  ets_model = ETS(WeeklyDemand)
)

# - Use glance() to compare AIC/BIC
glance(model_comparison)

# - Identify which model has the best trade-off

# ARIMA.

# Note: If you see a warning message about out-of-sample-data after running code
# in this activity, don’t worry, this is expected and won’t affect your results.
# The code still runs correctly and generates the output as intended.

# ================================================
# Activity 4: Bringing it All Together
# ================================================

# You’ve evaluated ARIMA, ETS, and naive forecasting models using accuracy metrics,
# cross-validation, and information criteria. Now it’s time to reflect.

# Scenario:
# Your manager has asked you to prepare a short internal summary ahead of a strategic planning meeting.
# Your team wants to know:
# Which model performed best overall?
# What should we recommend moving forward?

# You won’t be writing more code in this section.
# Instead, add your insights using # comments directly below.
# This mirrors how analysts document findings and prepare notes for decision-making.

# Task 1:

# Use # comments to summarize your analysis. You’re writing as if you're briefing your team lead.
# Consider:
# - Which model had the strongest accuracy (MAE, RMSE, MAPE)?
# - How stable were the results across folds in cross-validation?
# - What did AIC/BIC tell you about model complexity?
# - How would you explain your results to a non-technical teammate?

# Example:
# - Summary of Model Performance:
# - ARIMA had the lowest MAE and RMSE, and performed consistently across time.
# - ETS had slightly higher error but was easier to interpret.

# <YOUR REFLECTION COMMENTS HERE>

# Task 2: 
# Now shift into recommendation mode. Write 3–5 bullet-style next steps.
# Think about what actions the team should take and why your analysis supports them.

# Example:
# - Recommendations:
# - Adopt ARIMA for weekly demand forecasting in the next planning cycle.
# - Use cross-validation monthly to track performance changes.

# Task 1:
# Summary of Model Performance:
# ARIMA consistently had the best performance across MAE, RMSE, and MAPE, especially on the test set.
# It also showed stable results across folds in cross-validation, with relatively low variance.
# ETS was slightly more interpretable but had higher forecast errors.
# AIC and BIC both favored ARIMA, indicating a better trade-off between fit and complexity.
# If I were explaining this to a non-technical teammate, I’d say ARIMA is the most accurate and stable model, and it should be our go-to forecast method.

# Task 2:

# Recommendations:
# Use the ARIMA model as the default method for forecasting weekly demand.
# Continue monitoring performance monthly using cross-validation to catch any shifts in error patterns.
# Keep ETS as a backup model, especially when interpretability or quick deployment is needed.
# Reevaluate models quarterly as more data becomes available to ensure long-term reliability.
# Explore combining forecasts (ensemble approach) if future performance needs fine-tuning.
